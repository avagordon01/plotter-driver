# Plotter Driver

A few collected inkscape python extensions for ease of use with a plotter.

Inkscape python extensions have pretty terrible dependency management.

[iDraw](https://uunatek.com/product/idraw/) is a pen plotter based on the [AxiDraw](https://www.axidraw.com/). iDraw provides software based on the old version [1.0.2 of AxiDraw](https://github.com/evil-mad/axidraw/releases/tag/v1.0.2).

These extensions also depend on the [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) python modules.

## Install

`make install`

## TODO

- rebase any useful changes of iDraw onto version 1.0.2 of AxiDraw
- then rebase onto HEAD of AxiDraw
